# SmartSwitchClient
This is the software that allows control of SmartSwitch devices ([see repo "SmartSwitchServer"](../../../SmartSwitchServer)).

As of initial commit, the code in this repository is interpreted with Python 3.5.

I must warn anyone who decided they are interested in this project that I am not educated in programming and I lack a lot of "etiquette" when it comes to proper formatting and styles, etc. That said I'm in a constant learning process so you can expect it to improve over time, and I'm of course open to contributors who want to help.

Right now, only SmartSwitchServers are supported, but I have ideas for other type of devices: weather stations, infrared stations (for TV control and the like), etc.

Eventually I will replicate this repository into an Android app, at which point this repository will lose a lot of interest from me. It's more or less a testbed for WiFi control capabilities, and to encourage development of the [SmartSwitchServer](../../../SmartSwitchServer).

If you want to contribute, feel free to help by cleaning up the code in this repo and working toward PEP8 compliance. There's certainly a lot to do!
